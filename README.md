# Ideal-Crop-Classification
Many studies show that by the year 2050 there will not be enough food to feed the population. This model attempts to  solve this problem by determining whether crop leaf disease can be identified early in crops from images using machine learning and tensor flow. The stakeholders are farmers and production companies that use organic products.By developing an automated image classification system farmers and researchers could detect disease and take preventative action faster which can reduce crop loss and improve food security. During this project I will use a dataset from Kaggle  Ecosystem Plant Village Disease in all import plant crops. I believe a good outcome would be this project producing a reproducible pipeline with clear results so it can be used in real time with farmers.
